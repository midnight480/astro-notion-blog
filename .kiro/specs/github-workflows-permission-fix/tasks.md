# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add format check script to package.json
  - Create npm script for format checking (format:check) using prettier --check
  - Test the new format:check script works correctly with current codebase
  - Verify existing format and lint scripts still work properly
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Integrate lint and format checks into deploy-workers.yml
  - Add lint check step to build-and-test job after dependency installation
  - Add format check step to build-and-test job after lint check
  - Configure steps to fail the workflow when issues are detected
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Test the integrated workflow
  - Run the updated deploy-workers.yml workflow to verify all steps work
  - Test workflow failure scenarios with intentional lint/format violations
  - Confirm no permission errors occur during workflow execution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Remove redundant workflow files
  - Delete .github/workflows/format.yml completely
  - Delete .github/workflows/lint.yml completely
  - Verify no references to deleted workflows exist in other files
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 5. Update documentation for consolidated workflow
  - Update README.md to reflect the new single workflow approach
  - Document manual format and lint commands for developers
  - Explain the integrated CI/CD process
  - _Requirements: 3.3_
